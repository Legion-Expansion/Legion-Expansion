## Installation

You should download and install this mod via the Planetary Annihilation TITANS in-game Community Mod Manager. You will need to [enable Community Mods](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1417396826).

To create a copy for testing local changes:

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/)
2. Checkout origin/balance
3. Create and configure papaths.py in the root directory - see papaths.py.example
4. Run install_local_full.py - requires the pa_tools submodule
5. Within PA's Community Mods enable the "DEVELOPMENT" version of the mod

## Translations

If you would like to help translate Legion Expansion to one of PA's languages then please drop us a line in the [Legion Expansion forum thread](https://forums.uberent.com/threads/rel-legion-expansion-released.71680/).

## Development

### Structure

Please remove all unnecessary files from the pa and ui directories.

Only server mod files that will be uploaded to the server belong in the pa and ui directories (everything else should go into art)

JavaScript and JSON are formatted for readability with 2 space indent and sorted keys. They will be compressed when packaged into the mods.

Copy `papaths.py.example` to `papaths.py` then edit to update `PA_DATA_PATH` and `PA_MEDIA_PATH`.

Latest Python 3.x is required. Please do not use Python 2.x as whitespace formatting is different.

### Committing

1. Don't commit broken stuff to BALANCE. Develop, test and fix in your local, a feature branch, or your own fork.
2. Run format_json.py on your files with your PA_MEDIA_PATH in papaths.py so you don't commit unnecessary white spaces changes
3. Fix any MISSING FILE references in the format_json.py output
4. Use correct casing when referencing files so as to prevent issues on Linux

Our branch structure is based on the [GitFlow](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) model:

MASTER - release candidate; can be forked to HOTFIX-x.x.x; used to create release versions; never to be directly committed to

BALANCE - development; forked to RELEASE-x.x.x and FEATURE-_name_

FEATURE-_name_ - a feature which is still in development; merged into BALANCE on completion

HOTFIX-x.x.x - a critical fix for a current release; forks from MASTER and merged into MASTER and BALANCE

RELEASE-x.x.x - a version; fixes prior to release are done in this branch; forks from BALANCE and merged into MASTER and BALANCE

### Units

Vanilla units with `buildable_types` must be adjusted to ignore `Custom1`.

When working with Legion units please:

- prefix all Legion units directories and filenames with l\_
- follow Uber's naming conventions i.e. l_type_unit_adv (although some are different eg dox)
- for all Legion units that can build change buildable_types to "CUSTOM1 & ( existing_buildable_types )"
- check area builds i.e. area_build_separation
- create sea versions when needed in pa/units/sea/
- update pa/units/unit_list.json
- update pa/ai/unit_maps/imperial_legion.json
- update ui/mods/com.pa.legion-expansion/global.js
- add a build bar image
- add a strategic icon

If replacing existing vanilla units:

- use the same naming conventions for directories and files as the vanilla units
- set the base_spec to the vanilla unit to reduce copy / paste of duplicate information in unit JSON files
- add only changed properties to unit JSON files (everything else will inherit from the base_spec)

If you rename a unit directory:

- rename in pa/units/unit_list.json
- update pa/ai/unit_maps/imperial_legion.json
- rename in ui/mods/com.pa.legion-expansion/global.js
- rename the build bar image
- rename the strategic icon

### Strategic Icons

These should resemble existing strategic icons for similar units. All weapon capabilities must be indicated by the icon.

Add to ui/main/atlas/icon_atlas/img/strategic_icons/:

- filename format: `icon_si_l_unit.png`
- 52px x 52px
- #FFFF00 mask
- PNG32

### Build Bar Images

These should use a red tint.

Add to the same path as the unit's JSON file:

- filename format: `l_unit_icon_buildbar.png`
- 60px x 60px
- PNG32

### Projectiles

If you're changing projectiles and anti-projectiles remember to update anti_entity_targets e.g. nukes
