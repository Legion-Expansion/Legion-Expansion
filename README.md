## ECONOMY
*One major issue with Legion and MLA together in shared armies is that they cannot build their metal on the same spot together. In the past, this would be problematic because Legion T1 Mass Extractor + MLA T2 Advanced Metal Extractor would generate 1 more metal per second than a pure Legion-only T1/T2 Mass setup or a pure MLA-only T1/T2 Mass setup.*

*These changes seek to amend that, and also to make balancing Legion across different types of maps easier.*

*There are a lot of ripple effects caused by this, and a good majority of the changes in this mod seek to address the effects this has on Legion's early-game economy.*

### Mass Extractor
- Metal Production: 8 -> 7
- Cost: 220 -> 170
- Can now be built on top of MLA Advanced Metal Extractor.

### Advanced Mass Extractor
- Metal Production: 14 -> 15
- Cost: 2200 -> 2000
- Can now be built on top of MLA Metal Extractor.

### (MLA) Metal Extractor
- Can now be built on top of Legion Advanced Mass Extractor.

### (MLA) Advanced Metal Extractor
- Can now be built on top of Legion Mass Extractor.

## FABRICATORS

### Fabrication Walker
*Most competitive non-naval openings revolve heavily around the usage of MLA Bot Fabricators or Legion Fabrication Walkers. In order to compensate for the changes with T1 metal, we'll be adjusting the Fabrication Walker so it's a bit faster (albeit still slower than its MLA counterpart), costs less, and has the same fabrication rates as its MLA counterpart.*

*We hope the cheaper cost of a Fabrication Walker will help allow Legion players to get combat units onto the field earlier.*

- Cost: 150 -> 135
- Metal Usage: 9 -> 8
- Energy Usage: 650 -> 600
- Movement Speed: 14 -> 15
- Health: 65 -> 50

### Armour Fabricator
*The MLA Fabrication Vehicle and Legion Armour Fabricator are much less commonly seen in openings. As a result, the speed of the Armour Fabricator is less important to the viability of Legion earlygame expansion.*

- Cost: 200 -> 185
- Metal Usage: 13 -> 11
- Energy Usage: 850 -> 700
- Build Range: 45 -> 55

### Fabrication Flyer
- Cost: 225 -> 210
- Metal Usage: 10 -> 9
- Does not show up on enemy radar.

### Fabrication Ship
*Due to the sensitive nature of naval openings and the fact that MLA naval fabricators are already excruciatingly slow, we decided that it was best for the Fabrication Ship to have the same statistics as its MLA counterpart for now.*

- Cost: 240 -> 200
- Metal Usage: 16 -> 14
- Energy Usage: 850 -> 800
- Movement Speed: 9 -> 10

### Advanced Fabrication Walker
*We decided to take a similar approach here to the approach we took with the T1 Armour Fabricator*

- Cost: 2000 -> 1800
- Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
- Energy Usage: 2200 -> 1800
- Movement Speed: 14 -> 15
- Build Range: 45 -> 60
- Health: 150 -> 250

### Advanced Armour Fabricator
- Cost: 2250 -> 2025
- Metal Usage: 70 -> 60
- Energy Usage: 2750 -> 2250
- Movement Speed: 10 -> 11
- Build Range: 45 -> 60

### Advanced Fabrication Flyer
- Cost: 2400 -> 1950
- Metal Usage: 60 -> 54
- Energy Usage: 2500 -> 2250
- Does not show up on enemy radar.

### Advanced Fabrication Vessel
- Cost: 2700 -> 2400
- Metal Usage: 90 -> 80
- Movement Speed: 9 -> 10
- Health: 675 -> 600

##  FOUNDRIES
*Legion Foundries currently cost a bit more; their T1 Foundries specifically cost 10% more than MLA counterparts (without faster fabrication speed). This is particularly noticeable in T1. We've brought down Legion Foundry buildcosts to be in line with MLA. This will hopefully allow them to act more aggressively in the earlygame.*

*We've also had to adjust some Legion Foundry energy usage to bring them in line with MLA too.*

### Walker Foundry
- Cost: 660 -> 600
- Energy Usage: 640 -> 675

### Armour Foundry
- Cost: 660 -> 600
- Energy Usage: 640 -> 675

### Flyer Foundry
- Cost: 660 -> 600

### Ship Foundry
- Cost: 660 -> 600

### Advanced Walker Foundry
- Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
- Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Armour Foundry
- Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
- Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Flyer Foundry
- Metal Usage: 50 -> 45
- Energy Usage: 1650 -> 1500

### Advanced Ship Foundry
- Metal Usage: 65 -> 60
- Energy Usage: 1900 -> 1750
